.SH DESCRIPTION

Meawm_NG is a highly customizable window manager for the X Window system 
conforming to the latest EWMH specification. Meawm_NG supports multiple
virtual desktops and by using the cairo graphics library for all
rendering, meawm_ng provides a modern vector-based style engine that
takes advantage of display hardware acceleration when available (through 
the X Render Extension).


.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B "--display DISPLAYNAME"
X server to contact

.TP
.B "--rcfile RESOURCEFILE"
Use the alternate
.I RESOURCEFILE
instead of
.IR ~/.meawm_ngrc
and
.IR @pkgdatadir@/meawm_ngrc.

.TP
.B "--usage"
Display brief usage message

.TP
.B "--help"
Show full help message

.TP
.B "--version"
Output version information and exit

.P
Every setting avaiable in the
.B RESOURCE FILE
have an eqvivalent command line option that will override the
setting in the 
.B RESOURCE FILE.


.SH "RESOURCE FILE"
When starting, meawm_ng looks for a  
.I .meawm_ngrc 
resource file in the users home directory. If file doesn't exist, meawm_ng 
falls back to 
.I @pkgdatadir@/meawm_ngrc, 
the system wide configuration file. To force meawm_ng to read a different
configuration file use 
.I --rcfile
switch. Below is a list of configuration options that meawm_ng understands.

.TP
.B  screenMask:     List of screen numbers
Whitespace separated list of screens that meawm_ng should manage. 
If you for example want meawm_ng to handle only screen .0 and 
screen .2, then screenMask should be: '0 2'.
Option '--screen-mask' will override this setting.

.TP
.B scriptDir:     Dirpath
Path to alternate scripts directory
instead of
.IR @pkgdatadir@/scripts.
.I scriptDir 
is added to the PATH environment variable so that executables
in this directory can be called without directory path within
meawm_ng.
Option '--script-dir' will override this setting.

.TP
.B doubleClickInterval:     Integer
Adjust the delay (in milliseconds) between mouse clicks for meawm_ng
to consider it a double click. Default value is 
.I 300.
Option '--double-click' will override this setting.

.TP
.B clientSideRendering:     Boolean
Force meawm_ng to use client side rendering of all graphics.
Option '--client-side' will override this setting.

.TP
.B renderingThreads:     Integer
Number of threads to use for rendering. The main thread
will perform all rendering when set to 
.I 0. 
Having one or more threads doing rendering can produce smoother
graphic updates especially when using client-side rendering.
Default value is
.I 1.
Option '--threads' will override this setting.

.TP
.B renderingThreadPriority:     Integer
Priority of rendering threads. From -20 to 20, 20 being lowest priority
and -20 being real time priority. For most systems only priority values 
higher than the priority of the main thread is allowed. Default the 
priority is inherited from main thread.
Option '--thread-priority' will override this setting.

.P
When running meawm_ng on display with multiple screens the screen0 key in
the following configuration options can also be screen1, 2 etc. for any 
appropriate screen.

.TP
.B screen0.actionFile:     Filepath

.SH CONFIGURATION

Meawm_NG configuration files are in XML format. They can be read from
files and output of executables. When meawm_ng starts it reads three 
configuration files, 'actionFile', 'styleFile' and 'menuFile'. 
It's possible to read additional configuration files while meawm_ng
is running by using the action functions provided or by sending 
configuration file data from another X client to meawm_ng.

.P
For the current format of configuration files, see the 
Document Type Definition
.B @pkgdatadir@/meawm_ng.dtd.
